# COVID-Dynamics-Model-Comparison
Comparative study of the main techniques used for COVID modeling where the information available is infected, recovered and death curves, which is the most common scenario. The objective is to identify those techniques that produce the best results, analyzing whether the more complex models are really able to provide better predictions.
